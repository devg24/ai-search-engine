and head of google brain and was the former chief scientist at baidu building the companys artificial intelligence group into a team of several thousand people.ng is an adjunct professor at stanford university formerly associate professor and director of its stanford ai lab or sail. ng has also made substantial contributions to the field of online education as the cofounder of both coursera and deeplearning.ai. he has spearheaded many efforts to democratize deep learning teaching over 2.5 million students through his online courses. he is one of the worlds most famous and influential computer scientists being named one of time magazines 100 most influential people in 2012 and fast companys most creative people in 2014. in 2018 he launched and currently heads the ai fund initially a 175million investment fund for backing artificial intelligence startups. he has founded landing ai which provides aipowered saas products.', 'biography \\nng was born in the united kingdom in 1976. his parents ronald p. ng and tisa ho are both immigrants from hong kong. he has at least one brother. growing up he spent time in hong kong and singapore.in 1997 he earned his undergraduate degree with a triple major in computer science statistics and economics from carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania graduating at the top of his class. between 1996 and 1998 he also conducted research on reinforcement learning model selection and feature selection at the att bell labs.in 1998 ng earned his masters degree from the massachusetts institute of technology mit in cambridge massachusetts. at mit he built the first publicly available automatically indexed websearch engine for research papers on the web. it was a precursor to citeseerxresearchindex but specialized in machine learning.in 2002 he received his doctor of philosophy ph.d. from the university of california berkeley under the supervision of michael i. jordan. his thesis is titled shaping and policy search in reinforcement learning and is wellcited to this day.he started working as an assistant professor at stanford university in 2002 and as an associate professor in 2009.he currently lives in los altos hills california. in 2014 he married carol e. reiley. they have two children a daughter born in 2019 and a son born in 2021. the mit technology review named ng and reiley an ai power couple.', 'career', 'academia and teaching \\nng is a professor at stanford university departments of computer science and electrical engineering. he served as the director of the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory sail where he taught students and undertook research related to data mining big data and machine learning. his machine learning course cs229 at stanford is the most popular course offered on campus with over 1000 students enrolling some years. as of 2020 three of most popular courses on coursera are ngs machine learning #1 ai for everyone #5 neural networks and deep learning #6.in 2008 his group at stanford was one of the first in the us to start advocating the use of gpus in deep learning. the rationale was that an efficient computation infrastructure could speed up statistical model training by orders of magnitude ameliorating some of the scaling issues associated with big data. at the time it was a controversial and risky decision but since then and following ngs lead gpus have become a cornerstone in the field. since 2017 ng has been advocating the shift to highperformance computing hpc for scaling up deep learning and accelerating progress in the field.in 2012 along with stanford computer scientist daphne koller he cofounded and was ceo of coursera a website that offers free online courses to everyone. it took off with over 100000 students registered for ngs popular cs229a course. today several million people have enrolled in coursera courses making the site one of the leading massive open online course moocs in the world.', 'industry \\nfrom 2011 to 2012 he worked at google where he founded and directed the google brain deep learning project with jeff dean greg corrado and rajat monga.\\nin 2014 he joined baidu as chief scientist and carried out research related to big data and ai. there he set up several research teams for things like facial recognition and melody an ai chatbot for healthcare. he also developed for the company the ai platform called dueros and other technologies that positioned baidu ahead of google in the discourse and development of ai. in march 2017 he announced his resignation from baidu.he soon afterward launched deeplearning.ai an online series of deep learning courses. then ng launched landing ai which provides aipowered saas products.in january 2018 ng unveiled the ai fund raising 175 million to invest in new startups. in november 2021 landing ai secured a 57 million round of series a funding led by mcrock capital to help manufacturers adopt computer vision.', 'research \\nng researches primarily in machine learning deep learning machine perception computer vision and natural language processing and is one of the worlds most famous and influential computer scientists. hes frequently won best paper awards at academic conferences and has had a huge impact on the field of ai computer vision and robotics.during graduate school together with david m. blei and michael i. jordan ng coauthored the influential paper that introduced latent dirichlet allocation lda for his thesis on reinforcement learning for drones.his early work includes the stanford autonomous helicopter project which developed one of the most capable autonomous helicopters in the world. he was the leading scientist and principal investigator on the stair stanford artificial intelligence robot project which resulted in robot operating system ros a widely used open source software robotics platform. his vision to build an ai robot and put a robot in every home inspired scott hassan to back him and create willow garage. he is also one of the founding team members for the stanford wordnet project which uses machine learning to expand the princeton wordnet database created by christiane fellbaum.in 2011 ng founded the google brain project at google which developed largescale artificial neural networks using googles distributed computing infrastructure. among its notable results was a neural network trained using deep learning algorithms on 16000 cpu cores which learned to recognize cats after watching only youtube videos and without ever having been told what a cat is. the projects technology is also currently used in the android operating systems speech recognition system.', 'online education massive open online course \\nin 2011 stanford launched a total of three massive open online course moocs on machine learning cs229a databases and ai taught by ng peter norvig sebastian thrun and jennifer widom. this has led to the modern mooc movement. ng taught machine learning and widom taught databases. the course on ai taught by thrun led to the genesis of udacity. coursera was the 6th online education website that ng built and arguably the most successful to date.but we learned and learned and learned from the early prototypes until in 2011 we managed to build something that really took off. the seeds of massive open online courses moocs go back a few years before the founding of coursera in 2012. two themes emphasized in the founding of modern moocs were scale and availability.', 'founding of coursera \\nng started the stanford engineering everywhere see program which in 2008 published a number of stanford courses online for free. ng taught one of these courses machine learning which includes his video lectures along with the student materials used in the stanford cs229 class. it offered a similar experience to mit opencourseware except it aimed at providing a more complete course experience equipped with lectures course materials problems and solutions etc. the see videos were viewed by the millions and inspired ng to develop and iterate new versions of online tech.within stanford they include daphne koller with her blended learning experiences and codesigning a peergrading system john mitchell courseware a learning management system dan boneh using machine learning to sync videos later teaching cryptography on coursera bernd girod classx and others. outside stanford ng and thrun credit sal khan of khan academy as a huge source of inspiration. ng was also inspired by lynda.com and the design of the forums of stack overflow.widom ng and others were ardent advocates of khanstyled tablet recordings and between 2009 and 2011 several hundred hours of lecture videos recorded by stanford instructors were recorded and uploaded. ng tested some of the original designs with a local high school to figure the best practices for recording lessons.in october 2011 the applied version of the stanford class cs229a was hosted on mlclass.org and launched with over 100000 students registered for its first edition. the course featured quizzes and graded programming assignments and became one of the first and most successful massive open online courses moocs created by a stanford professor.two other courses on databases dbclass.org and ai aiclass.org were launched. the mlclass and dbclass ran on a platform developed by students including frank chen jiquan ngiam chuanyu foo and yifan mai. word spread through social media and popular press. the three courses were 10 weeks long and over 40000 statements of accomplishment were awarded.\\nng tells the following story on the early days of courserain 2011 i was working with four stanford students. we were under tremendous pressure to build new features for the 100000 students that were already signed up. one of the students frank chen claims another one jiquan ngiam frequently stranded him in the stanford building and refused to give him a ride back to his dorm until very late at night so he had no choice but to stick around and keep working. i neither confirm nor deny this story. his work subsequently led to his founding of coursera with koller in 2012. as of 2019 the two most popular courses on the platform were taught and designed by ng machine learning #1 and neural networks and deep learning #2.', 'postcoursera work \\nin 2019 ng launched a new course ai for everyone. this is a nontechnical course designed to help people understand ais impact on society and its benefits and costs for companies as well as how they can navigate through this technological revolution.', 'venture capital \\nng is the chair of the board for woebot labs a psychological clinic that uses data science to provide cognitive behavioral therapy. it provides a therapy chatbot to help treat depression among other things.he is also a member of the board of directors for drive.ai which uses ai for selfdriving cars and was acquired by apple in 2019.through landing ai he also focuses on democratizing ai technology and lowering the barrier for entrance to businesses and developers.', 'publications and awards \\nng is also the author or coauthor of over 300 publications in robotics and related fields. his work in computer vision and deep learning has been featured often in press releases and reviews.\\n1995. bell atlantic network

called ai transformation playbook.ng contributed one chapter to architects of intelligence the truth about ai from the people building it 2018 by the american futurist martin ford.', 'views on ai \\nng believes that ai technology will improve the lives of people not that it is an anathema that will enslave the human race. ng believes the potential benefits of ai outweigh the threats which he believes are exaggerated. he has stated thatworrying about ai evil superintelligence today is like worrying about overpopulation on the planet mars. we havent even landed on the planet yeta real threat is regarding the future of work rather than being distracted by evil killer robots the challenge to labor caused by these machines is a conversation that academia and industry and government should have. a particular goal of ngs work is to democratize ai learning so that people can learn more about it and understand its benefits. ngs stance on ai is shared by mark zuckerberg but opposed by elon musk.in 2017 ng said he supported basic income to allow the unemployed to study ai so that they can reenter the workforce. he has stated that he enjoyed erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafees the second machine age which discusses issues such as ai displacement of jobs.', 'see also \\nrobot operating system\\nlatent dirichlet allocation\\ngoogle brain\\ncoursera', 'references', 'external
